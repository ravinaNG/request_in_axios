### Tasks-
- Print whole courses. 
- take input from user and let the user select which course user wants to see.
- Inside the course there is Exercises and inside the Exercise there is childExerxise pring all the stuffs.
- again take input from user and let the user choose which exercise content user wants to see.
- print the content user have choosen.

### After finishing above tasks do this -
- #### (Up/next/previous) 
Give infinite option to user for next course/exercise, previous course/exercise and for starting. take input from user like up(u/U), next(N/n) and previous(P/p).
Take exit option too.

#### Used
- Node cache
- axios module
- readline-sync (for user input)

### The same thing I have done in python also using request module([code](https://github.com/ravinaNG/request_in_python)).
